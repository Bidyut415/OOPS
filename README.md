# OOPS

# 4 Pillars of OOP in java

# 1.Encapsulation:
  =>Wraping data & methods in one unit(class) to protect internal state

  # 2.Inheritance:
  =>Acquiring properties from parent class

  # 3.Polymorphism:
  =>one thing behaving multiple ways(method overloading/overriding)

  # 4.Abstraction:"
  =>Hiding internal details showing only essential features
